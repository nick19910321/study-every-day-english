Because for most people,buying an electrical car is not economically viable.因为电车不便宜It is not uncommon for Chinese people to travel abroad,because they have more disposable income now.出国游很普遍，因为人们有钱了。 


## 对自己要求高点 目标再清晰点 能很快提高能力 逐字稿 复述 讲给别人听 就是高要求 实际上大多数人终其一生都在复述别人的话 所以没有必要追求独一无二 先做到复述再说 我们都是在说别人说过的话 模仿复述别人说过的话 大声朗读别人说过的话 能提高你的记忆力

## 先说什么后说什么 体现组织结构能力 把结构框架搭好
