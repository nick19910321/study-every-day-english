toursist numbers have increased considerably 游客数量越来越多
economically viable 便宜
flexiable patterns of work 工作灵活 有灵活时间
disposable income 有闲钱 有钱
a trend towards adventure tourism喜欢探险的人越来越多 越来越流行探险
具象的表达非常接地气 容易理解 没有抽象概念 
增长的行业/经济上可行/可处置的收入/探险的趋势 这些词非常抽象 不易理解 不易使用

I have chosen to learn computers because it's a growing industry. 因为计算机发展前景好
